# Linear B Open Control Corpus

## Current status — 4.9.22

Corrected and field-by-field-audited DAMOS mapping: 5932 records, 5890 nonempty surfaces, 3945 scribe labels and 1305 inventory identifiers. The phonetic smoke samples from the 5890 eligible records and explicitly excludes 42 missing surfaces. Gold calibration and graphical baseline remain blocked.

Family contract 1.2 aligns all five projects with [Phaistos Disc 1.0](https://github.com/hawkinsnick/Phaistos-Disc/releases/tag/v1.0.0). The shared readiness report preserves native sampling units, source rights and blocked linguistic controls. It authorizes no pooling or linguistic relationship claim. See [`research/family-readiness-v1.json`](research/family-readiness-v1.json).

The authoritative current gate summary is [`analysis/current-status.json`](analysis/current-status.json). Historical release reports below retain their original versions and claims.
